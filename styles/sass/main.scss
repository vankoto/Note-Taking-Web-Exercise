/* There are many ways to structure a sass file, files for buttons, colors, images, etc.
I decided to make it by sections and not having many files, just fix a specific section and that's all. */

/* In helpers sub-folder I have variables, mixins and boxsizing file. */
@import "helpers/variables";
@import "helpers/mixins";
@import "helpers/boxsizing";

/* The layout sub-folder contains only the footer and the header. */
@import "layout/header";
@import "layout/footer";

/* I decided to make elements folder to hold different parts of the home page and register page.
There is not much in the register page so it contains only sections from the home page.*/
@import "elements/login";
@import "elements/introduction";
@import "elements/contentbelow";

/* This is the folder which contains the main content of both pages - the home page and the register page.
In this case home sass file contains the notes of the home page. */

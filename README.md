# Note Taking Web Exercise - Job Assignment
This is where I have described the overall structure of the project, why I did it the way it is, what I could have done
better, etc.
## Initial Setup
The moment I saw the assignment I decided to start doing the front-end and I said to myself if I have some time left I will
do the back-end as well. Unfortunately three days of those two weeks I could not work. I think I could have done the whole
assignment if I had more time. Anyways, the technologies that I used are the ones listed in the pdf file.
For the SASS folder I decided to keep everything in one file in the beginning, but later on when the file got bigger I split the file with the help of partials. I decided to keep the design of the website simple, clean and at the same time professional.

## Working process
During those two weeks I really enjoyed doing the assignment and had fun. There were days where I worked more and there were also days where I worked less. I did not face many problems during the period, except when I had to deal with the media queries. I had problems with min-width and max-width for the line on the navigation bar. The properties that I set for mobile version were messing with the other screen sizes as well, but I managed to fix it. There are originally prefixed screen sizes on the internet, but I made some changes to my sizes because with media-queries it is important to make screen pixel sizes which fit the needs of your own web application.

## Before delivery
If I had more time as I mentioned above I could have done more, but as the assignment says, it is not necessary to do everything. I managed to create a UML Diagram in a program called `Astah`. Afterwards I created the database using not the best tool out there but still it delivers results called `WAMP server`. I inserted some dummy information into the database and this is where my time was up.
